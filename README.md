# iCON - WDI 14 Project 3
#### This project will be my first project utilizing a MERN stack deployed with Heroku! iCON is an app that will provide a platform for users to check out some of their favorite Cons around the country and add themselves to the attendee list of the conventions that they are attending! On each convention is a shout out page for people to share information, talk about what they are excited about, or just make some noise in anticipation of going to their favorite convention. Check out the users going to each con and see what your fellow con goers are all about.Making the rounds at DragonCon this year? Sign up on iCON and see who all is going to be marching down the streets as a Stormtrooper with you!!!!!

## Desired additions:

* ### An increase in the complexity of relationships and tackling accessing objects through objectID's will aid in a more rich user experience.

* ### I will be adding if statements to help populate lack of profile pictures on user profile additions. Thanks for the tip Marco!

* ### Need to create dropdowns for certain form fields to make some items more uniform - i.e. Country of origin for users. I would also like to increase the database size to include more whisky producing countries and whiskies.

* ### I would like to utilize user authentification in order to create an actual login to the site and restrict manipulation of other user's data.

* ### Styles need to be more fluid and need a great deal of work.
