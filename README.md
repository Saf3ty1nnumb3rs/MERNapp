# iCON - WDI 14 Project 3
#### This project will be my first project utilizing a MERN stack deployed with Heroku! iCON is an app that will provide a platform for users to check out some of their favorite Cons around the country and add themselves to the attendee list of the conventions that they are attending! On each convention is a shout out page for people to share information, talk about what they are excited about, or just make some noise in anticipation of going to their favorite convention. Check out the users going to each con and see what your fellow con goers are all about.Making the rounds at DragonCon this year? Sign up on iCON and see who all is going to be marching down the streets as a Stormtrooper with you!!!!!

## Desired additions:

* ### An increase in the complexity of relationships and tackling accessing objects through objectID's will aid in a more rich user experience.

* ### I will be adding if statements to help populate lack of profile pictures on user profile additions. Thanks for the tip Marco!

* ### I would like to utilize user authentification in order to create an actual login to the site and restrict manipulation of other user's data.

* ### Styles need to be more fluid and need a great deal of work.


## Technologies Used for the Development of This App

* MongoDB
* ExpressJS
* ReactJS
* NodeJS
* Semantic UI for React
* Heroku
* Full MERN stack

### Favorite Bug:

### Thoughts On Process:
## On approach, I had spent a great deal of time forming fuctional data relationships (ERDs), wireframes, and then creating user stories with a clear definition of what was required in development and for the user experience. As our projects become more complex, the need for organization and task-based execution becomes paramount.
## For styling, I've utilized Semantic UI for React. Although, I have a preference for raw CSS, Semantic is quite useful for quick styling execution. Although some styles from Semantic lean toward the generic, they are clean and effective. Semantic is a welcome addition to the development toolbelt.

## Takeaways:

### I find that some students collapse Express routing and React routing when building out their projects. React is built over Express but their routes are not the same. Server routes are able to deliver multiple resources to a single view through React - recognizing this enables the development of highly functional and versatile user experiences on the client side.
